# Java Virtual Threads

Java Virtual Threads are a lightweight concurrency model introduced to make high-performance and scalable applications easier to write. Unlike traditional platform threads, virtual threads are much more lightweight, enabling Java applications to handle many more concurrent tasks.

## 1. What are Virtual Threads?

Virtual threads are threads that are managed by the Java runtime rather than being tied directly to operating system (OS) threads. This allows the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to create and manage thousands (or even millions) of threads more efficiently than platform threads.

## 2. Key Benefits of Virtual Threads:
- **Scalability**: Virtual threads allow a much higher number of concurrent threads than platform threads, making them suitable for large-scale applications, such as web servers handling many simultaneous requests.
- **Lightweight**: Each virtual thread is lightweight and consumes fewer resources than a traditional OS thread.
- **Simpler Concurrency**: Developers can write code using a simpler threading model, without worrying about performance hits from creating many threads.

## 3. Platform Threads vs. Virtual Threads

The image below demonstrates the difference between platform threads and virtual threads:

### Platform Threads:
- **Heavyweight**: Each platform thread is directly tied to an OS thread.
- **Limited by OS Resources**: The number of platform threads is limited by the operating system's resources, making it harder to scale.
- **Thread Management**: The OS handles the context switching between threads, which is more resource-intensive.

### Virtual Threads:
- **Lightweight**: Virtual threads are lightweight and not tied directly to an OS thread.
- **High Scalability**: The JVM can create and manage many virtual threads, allowing for better scalability.
- **Efficient**: The JVM schedules virtual threads efficiently, reducing overhead compared to platform threads.

## 4. Example Code: Creating Virtual Threads in Java
Below is a simple example of how to create virtual threads in Java:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Virtual thread is running!");
        });
    }
}
```

## 5. Use Cases for Virtual Threads:
- **Web Servers**: Handling thousands or millions of concurrent requests.
- **Microservices**: Managing numerous asynchronous tasks simultaneously.
- **Background Processing**: Performing background tasks without consuming too many resources.

## 6. Conclusion

Java Virtual Threads offer a modern, lightweight concurrency model that enables developers to write highly scalable applications with ease. By decoupling threads from OS threads, virtual threads make it possible to handle massive numbers of concurrent tasks with minimal overhead.
