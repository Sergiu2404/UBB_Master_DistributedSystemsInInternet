# Java Annotations

## Overview

Java annotations provide metadata about the program. Annotations don't directly affect program execution but give data to the compiler or runtime about the code.

Annotations can be used to give information about code behavior and manage framework-based processes, validations, or configurations.

## Types of Annotations

Java has built-in annotations, and users can create custom annotations. The key types include:

1. **Marker Annotations**: These don't contain any members. They are only used to mark a declaration. For example, `@Override`.
2. **Single-Value Annotations**: These annotations contain only one element or member. For example, `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")`.
3. **Full Annotations**: These contain multiple elements. For example, `@MyAnnotation(key="value", anotherKey="anotherValue")`.

## Built-in Annotations

1. **@Override**
   - Indicates that a method is overriding a method in a superclass.
   - Helps the compiler catch errors where a method might not correctly override the parent class’s method.

   ```java
   @Override
   public String toString() {
       return "Example";
   }
   ```

2. **@Deprecated**
   - Marks a method as deprecated. A deprecated method should not be used, as it may be removed in future versions.
   
   ```java
   @Deprecated
   public void oldMethod() {
       // logic
   }
   ```

3. **@SuppressWarnings**
   - Tells the compiler to ignore specific warnings that it would normally generate.
   
   ```java
   @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
   public void someMethod() {
       // logic
   }
   ```

4. **@SafeVarargs**
   - Indicates that a method with varargs parameters doesn't perform unsafe operations on its varargs argument.

   ```java
   @SafeVarargs
   public static <T> void method(T... args) {
       // logic
   }
   ```

5. **@FunctionalInterface**
   - Used to declare that an interface is intended to be a functional interface (an interface with only one abstract method).

   ```java
   @FunctionalInterface
   public interface MyFunction {
       void perform();
   }
   ```

## Meta-Annotations

Meta-annotations are annotations that are applied to other annotations to control how they behave.

1. **@Retention**: Specifies how long annotations should be retained (e.g., source, class, runtime).
2. **@Target**: Specifies the types of Java elements an annotation can be applied to (e.g., method, field, type).
3. **@Inherited**: Indicates that an annotation type is automatically inherited.
4. **@Documented**: Marks whether the use of the annotation is documented by javadoc and similar tools.

```java
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface CustomAnnotation {
    String value();
}
```

## Custom Annotations

Developers can create their own annotations using the `@interface` keyword.

### Example of Custom Annotation

```java
import java.lang.annotation.ElementType;
import java.lang.annotation.Retention;
import java.lang.annotation.RetentionPolicy;
import java.lang.annotation.Target;

@Target(ElementType.METHOD) // Can be used on methods
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) // Available at runtime
public @interface MyAnnotation {
    String value();
}

class Example {
    @MyAnnotation(value = "This is a custom annotation")
    public void annotatedMethod() {
        // logic
    }
}
```

---

## Annotation Processing

Annotations are processed at different stages:

1. **Source-Level**: Used by tools and frameworks during compilation.
2. **Class-Level**: Stored in the `.class` file but not available at runtime.
3. **Runtime**: Available at runtime for reflection purposes.

Annotations like `@Override` are processed at compile time, while annotations like `@Autowired` in Spring can be processed at runtime.

---

## Use of Annotations in Frameworks

Annotations are extensively used in frameworks like **Spring**, **Hibernate**, and **JPA**.

- **Spring Framework**: Uses annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Component`, `@Service`, etc., for dependency injection and configuration.
- **JPA/Hibernate**: Uses annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id` to map Java classes to database tables.

Example in Spring:

```java
@Service
public class MyService {
    @Autowired
    private MyRepository repository;

    public void perform() {
        // logic using repository
    }
}
```

---

## Summary

Annotations in Java offer a powerful way to add metadata to code and are heavily used for configuring and managing frameworks. They simplify code, enable reflection, and allow for flexible, scalable applications. Understanding both built-in and custom annotations helps in better leveraging frameworks and building clean, maintainable code.
