## 1. Download and Extract WildFly

1. **Download**: Go to the [WildFly downloads page](https://wildfly.org/downloads/) and download the latest stable release (in `.zip` or `.tar.gz` format).
2. **Extract**: Extract the downloaded file to your preferred directory (e.g., `C:\wildfly` on Windows or `/opt/wildfly` on Linux/Mac).

## 2. Configure WildFly

### Basic Configuration

1. **Navigate to the WildFly Home Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/wildfly
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables** (Optional):
   - Add the WildFly `bin` directory to your system’s `PATH` variable for easier access.
   - For Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     export WILDFLY_HOME=/path/to/wildfly
     export PATH=$WILDFLY_HOME/bin:$PATH
     ```
   - On Windows, add `WILDFLY_HOME` and the `bin` directory to your system PATH in Environment Variables.

### Configure a Management User

1. **Run the add-user.sh/add-user.bat script** from the `bin` directory:
   ```bash
   ./bin/add-user.sh
   ```
2. Choose to add a Management User and follow the prompts to set up the username and password.

3. **Access the Management Console**:
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:9990`.
   - Log in with the management user credentials created.

### Configuring Ports (Optional)

- WildFly defaults to `8080` for applications and `9990` for the management console.
- To change these, edit `standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` under the `socket-binding` group.

## 3. Starting WildFly Server

WildFly supports two main modes: standalone and domain.

### Start in Standalone Mode

1. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the `wildfly/bin` directory.
2. **Start WildFly** with the command:
   ```bash
   ./standalone.sh   # For Linux/Mac
   standalone.bat    # For Windows
   ```
3. WildFly should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Start in Domain Mode (Optional)

For managing multiple servers:

1. Run the command:
   ```bash
   ./domain.sh   # For Linux/Mac
   domain.bat    # For Windows
   ```

## 4. Deploy Applications to WildFly

- **Automatic Deployment**: Copy `.war` or `.ear` files to `standalone/deployments/` to deploy automatically.
- **Management Console Deployment**:
   - Open `http://localhost:9990`.
   - Go to **Deployments** > **Add**, then upload and deploy your application.

## 5. Stop WildFly Server

To stop the server:

1. Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where WildFly is running.
2. Alternatively, run the shutdown command:
   ```bash
   ./jboss-cli.sh --connect command=:shutdown
   ```
